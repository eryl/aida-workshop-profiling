# AIDA Technical Workshop - Profiling and improving pytorch experiments

This repository contain material for the AIDA technical workshop on profiling and improving pytorch experiments. You can follow the workshop by running the notebook `profiling_experiment.ipynb` either [locally](profiling_experiment.ipynb) or on [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eryl/aida-workshop-profiling/blob/main/profiling_experiment.ipynb).

The notebook is mainly intended to be used when running on colab, otherwise the commands in it can more readily be run in a shell on your local computer.
